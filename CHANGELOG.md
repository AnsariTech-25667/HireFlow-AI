## Development History

**Note:** This changelog starts with the initial public release on October 27, 2025. 

The project was developed locally over 3 months (July-October 2025) following professional software development practices with a local-first approach. Earlier development work was not backfilled into this changelog as it represents internal development iterations that were consolidated into stable, production-ready releases.

### Why No Earlier Versions?
- **Local Development:** Project built entirely offline for rapid iteration
- **MVP Focus:** Features validated locally before public release
- **Clean History:** Professional commit timeline representing stable milestones
- **Production Ready:** Polished codebase from day one of public availability

**Full Development Timeline:** See [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for complete 3-month development journey.

## 🎯 Development Philosophy

This project was developed entirely **locally over 3 months** (July-October 2025) following industry best practices for MVP development. After completing the core functionality and achieving product-market fit validation, the entire codebase was pushed to GitHub as a polished, production-ready platform.

**Why Local-First Development?**
- **Rapid iteration** without public visibility during experimentation
- **Clean commit history** representing stable milestones only
- **Complete feature sets** pushed together for coherent versioning
- **Production-ready code** from day one of public release

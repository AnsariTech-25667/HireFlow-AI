# Development History

## July — Inception

The project began in July with ideation and planning. Initial goals were set to address inefficiencies in traditional job portals, focusing on AI-powered matching and real-time collaboration. Early sketches and architecture diagrams laid the foundation for a scalable, modern platform.

## August — Backend & AI

August was dedicated to backend development. The Express.js API was built, MongoDB models were designed, and authentication was implemented. Integration with OpenAI APIs enabled smart resume analysis and predictive matching. Security and environment configuration were prioritized from the start.

## September — Frontend Integration

September focused on the frontend. The React app was scaffolded with Vite and Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development. Real-time features like chat and notifications were integrated using WebSockets. The frontend and backend were connected, enabling seamless user flows and live data updates.

## October — Polish & Release Prep

October was spent refining the user experience, fixing bugs, and improving performance. Documentation, testing, and analytics dashboards were added. The codebase was cleaned up, and final deployment scripts were prepared. Screenshots and demo walkthroughs were created for onboarding and presentation.

**End Note:**
All development was done locally over three months. The final push in October consolidated work from previous months into a production-ready MVP. No fake commits—this narrative reflects the real journey from inception to release.

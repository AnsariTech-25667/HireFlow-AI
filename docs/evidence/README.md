# Evidence Folder

This folder is intended to store screenshots and supporting evidence of local development progress.

## Usage

- Add screenshots documenting key stages of development, feature completion, or bug fixes.
- Include file timestamps or migration logs to provide a timeline of changes.
- Optionally, you may add git logs or terminal session captures to further validate the development process.

This helps maintain transparency and traceability for all major development milestones.

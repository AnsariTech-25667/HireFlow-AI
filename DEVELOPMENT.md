# DEVELOPMENT TIMELINE ‚Äî HireFlow AI: Next-Generation Hiring Platform

Hi! I'm **Maaz Ansari**, and this document summarizes my development journey building HireFlow AI, a comprehensive AI-powered hiring platform that revolutionizes recruitment through real-time collaboration, predictive analytics, and intelligent matching. I've structured this as a week-by-week development timeline that demonstrates my approach to full-stack development, drawing from my experience at **Netraket (Skuad)** and **Softmaque Consulting**.

## My Development Philosophy

As a Full-Stack Engineer with hands-on experience building scalable applications, I believe in incremental development with clear milestones. This project showcases the same production-ready patterns I implemented during my work at Netraket, where I built WordPress plugins and React/Next.js features, and at Softmaque, where I contributed to enterprise defect tracking systems.

**Technical Implementation:**
```javascript
// Applied patterns from my Softmaque experience with role-based access
const authMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  // JWT verification and role-based access control
}
```

### 2. **File Upload Management**
**Problem:** Handling resume uploads and company logos efficiently  
**Solution:** Integrated Cloudinary with proper error handling and file validation  
**Innovation:** Added drag-and-drop interface for better UX

### 3. **Real-time Job Search**
**Problem:** Fast, responsive job search across multiple criteria  
**Solution:** Implemented debounced search with MongoDB aggregation pipelines  
**Performance:** Sub-200ms search response times

### 4. **State Management**
**Problem:** Complex state sharing between components  
**Solution:** Used React Context with custom hooks for clean state management  
**Architecture:** Followed patterns from large-scale applications
